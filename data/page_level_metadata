    "content": "At the dinner table in my father's home when I was a girl if I, or one of my siblings, knocked a glass over on the tablecloth or dropped a knife, my father's voice would thunder, \"Watch your manners!\"  If we used our bread to mop up pasta sauce, he yelled, \"Don't lick your plates. Don't dribble! Don't slobber!\"  For my father dribble and slobber also described modern painting, which he couldn't stand.  He would say, \"You have no idea how to behave at the table! I can't take you lot anywhere.\"  And he said, \"Any table d'h\u00f4te in England would quickly show you slobs the door.\"  He had the greatest respect for England and believed that civility had found there, more than anywhere else in the world, its greatest expression.  At dinner he'd comment on the people he'd encountered during the day. He was very harsh in his judgments and thought everyone was stupid. For him someone stupid was a \"nitwit.\"  \"He struck me as a real nitwit,\" he would say about some new acquaintance.  In addition to the \"nitwits,\" there were also the \"negroes.\" For my father, a \"negro\" was someone who was awkward, clumsy, and faint-hearted; someone who dressed inappropriately, didn't know how to hike in the mountains, and couldn't speak foreign languages.  Any act or gesture of ours he deemed inappropriate was defined as a \"negroism.\"",
