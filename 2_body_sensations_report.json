She would make sure I felt this almost every day of my life. The little girl who wanted nothing more than to receive and give love slowly retreated into the winter of my soul.\n\nI lived in a two-parent household. Prior to my mother joining the workforce, my father, who was given the name Daydee by my oldest brother because he couldn\u2019t say daddy, was the sole provider. Ma was the stay-at-home wife and disciplinarian to what would become eight children. I am the eldest daughter of the brood. She was a stern, no nonsense, exacting woman. As an only child, she worked during her high school years to help her mother keep their home. Her philosophy was her way, or the highway.\n\nWe were treated like enlistees in her one-woman army, always lining up oldest to the youngest to receive our marching orders.",

Ma told me it was better than a doll because now I could learn to iron the small clothing items for the family\u2014handkerchiefs, underwear, and such.

Ma was sending me to get a gallon of milk and a few other items. The milk came in glass containers with a plastic handle. My sister\u2014the one I shared the bedroom with\u2014begged to come along. I refused. I was always looking after one sibling or another, and I just wanted a moment of peace.\n\nOf course, Ma had other ideas. \u201cTake your sister with you,\u201d she said, warning me about what would happen if I didn\u2019t keep watch over her.",
